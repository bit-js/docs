title: JIT Compiler
description: JIT compilers in Byte.

Byte includes a JIT compiler for inlining method calls.

Here is an example application:
```ts
const app = new Byte()
    .use(f1)
    .defer(f2)
    .get('/', f3);
```

The route will be stored as:
```ts
const route = {
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/',
    handler: f3,
    actions: [[[2, f1]]]
    defers: [[f2]]
};
```

With the JIT compiler the route execution can be simplified to:
```ts
async function run(ctx: Context) {
    // Run middlewares
    const c1 = await f1(ctx);
    if (c1 instanceof Response) return c1;

    let r = await f4(ctx);
    
    const c2 = await f2(ctx);
    if (c2 instanceof Response) r = c2;

    return r;
}
```

This reduces the amount of unnecessary checks the handlers need to do at request time.

The compiler can optimize even more in these cases:
- If a function has no parameter then do not pass `ctx` as an argument.
- If a function is not asynchronous then remove `await`.
- If no functions have parameters then the `run` function does not need `ctx` as a parameter.
- If no functions are asynchronous then the `run` function can be synchronous.

The source code of the compiler can be seen [here](https://github.com/bit-js/byte/blob/main/src/core/server/route.ts#L61).

### Route matching
The route matching phase uses the [Blitz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bit-js/blitz) router, which compiles the routes into an optimized matching function.
You can skip JIT compilation for this phase by using [EdgeRouter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bit-js/blitz#edge-router).
```ts
import { EdgeRouter } from '@bit-js/blitz';

// Build the fetch function with EdgeRouter
app.build(new EdgeRouter());
```
